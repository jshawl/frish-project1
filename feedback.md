### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Meets expectations

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

Excellent user stories and bronze silver gold platinum plan!

* __Technical Requirements__: Meets expectations

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

The move to ditch jQuery for vanilla JS on this project was the right move. Excellent job!

* __Code Quality__: Meets expectations

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Problem Solving__: Meets expectations

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

Excellent job getting the questions / answers to populate dynamically. Thing to focus on next: a more complex data structure to hold
your question/answer pairings.
